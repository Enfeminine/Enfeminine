- 👋 Hi, I’m @Enfeminine
- 👀 I’m interested in being able to teach people what cryptocurrencies and NFTs are
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reach more people and make them aware of the benefits of Blockchain
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on and that developers collaborate with me to coin NFTs, which teach a peculiar educational art, focused especially on women
- 📫 How to reach me in e-mail
